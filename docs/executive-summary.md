# Executive Summary

The KOFI Network is a project leverages blockchain technology from Komodo Platformâ€™s multi-chain architecture. Notarizations from existing cross-chain security enables voting to be resistant to deep chain re-organizations.

This resilience enables KOFI to introduce network consensus for hardened cross-chain wrapping (bridging or gatewaying) of a coin securely onto another chain. Hardened gateways mitigate risk to the game asset owner, whilst rewarding them with gameplay tokens; redeemable for their native coin & tradeable on any cross-chain DEX.

The asset owner is able to use these wrapped coins on other chains in the KOFI Network and greater Komodo smartchains ecosystem.

KOFI layer-1 consensus makes use of crypto-conditions, an IETF draft for language agnostic protocols, applications & smart contracts. 

KOFI introduces cross-chain bootstrapping protocols for gameplay, governance & the adjustment of protocol variables in a transparent and democratic way.

KOFI further brings lightning fast payments for in-game transactions using channels that are opened on-chain by the asset owner, to enable quick microtransactions.

KOFI brings the DEX P2P messaging from the global p2p orderbook of atomicdex network and refits it for use as a secure trading network for game assets.
