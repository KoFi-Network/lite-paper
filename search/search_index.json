Notarizations from existing cross-chain security enables voting to be resistant to deep chain re-organizations. This resilience enables KOFI to introduce network consensus for hardened cross-chain wrapping (bridging or gatewaying) of a coin securely onto another chain. Hardened gateways mitigate risk to the game asset owner, whilst rewarding them with gameplay tokens; redeemable for their native coin & tradeable on any cross-chain DEX. The asset owner is able to use these wrapped coins on other chains in the KOFI Network and greater Komodo smartchains ecosystem. KOFI layer-1 consensus makes use of crypto-conditions, an IETF draft for language agnostic protocols, applications & smart contracts. KOFI introduces cross-chain bootstrapping protocols for gameplay, governance & the adjustment of protocol variables in a transparent and democratic way. KOFI further brings lightning fast payments for in-game transactions using channels that are opened on-chain by the asset owner, to enable quick microtransactions. KOFI brings the DEX P2P messaging from the global p2p orderbook of atomicdex network and refits it for use as a secure trading network for game assets.","title":"Executive Summary"},{"location":"executive-summary/#executive-summary","text":"The KOFI Network is a project leverages blockchain technology from Komodo Platform\u2019s multi-chain architecture.
